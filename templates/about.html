	<h1>About</h1>

	<h3>College</h3>
	<p>I currently attend The University of Virginia. I am majoring Computer Science in the School of Engineering, and minoring in Physics. See my <a href="/resume">resume</a> for more details.</p>

	<h3>Linux</h3>
	<p>I have been using Linux for 3 years and I'm currently using <a href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro Linux</a>. During this time, I have tinkered with the linux operating system and gained a fair amount of knowledge of how it works. I've written numerous scripts to automate my workflow and created several simple commandline tools as personal projects.</p>
